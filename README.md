## What have we done so far?
So far, we have embarked on an ambitious project to build a website dedicated to disseminating fundamental economic knowledge, with a special emphasis on topics such as US treasury bonds, GDP, inflation, and the intricate relationships between them. We've successfully acquired the necessary data pertaining to treasury bonds and GDP, marking a significant step forward in our content development process. Additionally, we've made considerable headway in the aspect of data visualization, crafting interactive and informative visual aids to better illustrate these complex economic concepts to our audience. A unique feature we've integrated into our website is a live-drawn animated line that flows across the background, adding a dynamic and engaging visual element to the user interface.

## What will be the most challenging of our project to design and why?
The most challenging aspect of our project is undoubtedly the design and implementation of the live-drawn animated line in the website's background. This feature, while visually striking, requires intricate coding to ensure its smooth integration and operation within the website's framework. Specifically, using the index to accurately determine the animated line's position on the webpage and managing the stroke-dasharray effect for the animation pose significant technical hurdles. These challenges are primarily due to our team's limited experience in web development, particularly in the nuanced areas of advanced CSS and JavaScript animation techniques. Additionally, ensuring that this animated feature seamlessly integrates with the website's overall design and functionality without detracting from the user experience or the delivery of economic content is a delicate balance that adds complexity to the project.
